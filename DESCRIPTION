Description: GenomicLLM facilitates the conversion of genomic data, such as 
    methylation and acetylation measurements, into formats compatible with 
    Large Language Models (LLMs) for comparative analysis. The package provides 
    tools to aggregate, compare, and visualize multiple epigenetic features 
    across genomic ranges, creating detailed input sequences for LLM training 
    and testing. It supports various styles of data representation, ensuring 
    flexibility and adaptability for different machine learning models. 
    Additionally, it allows for splitting data into training and test sets, 
    and supports integration with multiple genomic feature files. The package 
    aims to bridge the gap between genomic data analysis and machine learning, 
    enabling advanced pattern recognition and predictive modeling in genomics.
