## Introduction

`GenomicLLM` is a comprehensive package designed to transform genomic comparisons from feature data in GRanges objects into datasets ready for training language models (LLMs). This package leverages the power of S4 objects for robust data handling and provides functionality for aggregating feature data, converting it into various formats suitable for machine learning tasks, and performing genomic data comparisons.

### Key Features

- **Reading BED Files**: The `readFile` function reads BED files and creates `GRangesData` objects.
- **Aggregating Feature Data**: The `aggregateFeature` function aggregates feature data for genomic comparisons.
- **Converting to LLM Format**: The `toLLMFormat` function converts comparison data into JSON format suitable for LLM training.
- **S4 Object Oriented Design**: Utilizes S4 objects for robust and scalable data management.

## Reading BED Files

The `readFile` function reads BED files and creates `GRangesData` objects, which encapsulate the genomic ranges and associated metadata.

```{r example1, eval=TRUE}
# Read the sample BED file
gr_data <- readFile(bed_file)
print(gr_data)
```

## Aggregating Feature Data

The `aggregateFeature` function aggregates feature data, providing a comparison between two genomic conditions. It extends the ranges upstream by a specified number of base pairs and calculates average feature values.

```{r example2, eval=TRUE}
# Create another sample GRangesData object
gr_data2 <- readFile(bed_file)
metadata2 <- data.table(name = c("gene3", "gene4"), type = c("type3", "type4"), feature_level = c(30, 40))
gr_data2 <- new("GRangesData", granges = gr_data@granges, metadata = metadata2)

# Create a ComparisonData object
comparison <- new("ComparisonData", condition1 = gr_data, condition2 = gr_data2, features = c("methylation"), ranges = "upstream", bp_window = 1000, output_consequence = "isoform_switch_consequence", system_prompt = "Analyze the following sequences:")

# Aggregate feature data
comparison <- aggregateFeature(comparison)
print(comparison@results)
```

## Converting to LLM Format

The toLLMFormat function converts the aggregated comparison data into JSON format, ready for LLM training. This function also allows for splitting the data into training and test sets, which is crucial for machine learning workflows.

LLM Language Format Options
The toLLMFormat function supports multiple language format styles for the output. Below is a table describing the available options along with examples of their output:


```{r example3, eval=TRUE}
# Convert comparison data to LLM format
llm_data <- toLLMFormat(comparison, split_ratio = 0.8, style = "Bracket-Spacing")
print(llm_data)
```

## Output Styles

The `createFormattedInput` function supports various output styles:

- **Bracket-Spacing**: This style includes spaces to indicate gaps between feature comparisons.

  Example:
  ```plaintext
  [10, 20] {34} [30, 40]
  ```

- **Letter-Digit**: This style uses letters and digits to format the input, with spaces indicating gaps.

  Example:
  ```plaintext
  A(10, 20) S(34) A(30, 40)
  ```

- **Simple-List**: This style formats the input as a simple list with spaces indicating gaps.

  Example:
  ```plaintext
  [10, 20], {34} [30, 40]
  ```

- **Verbose**: This style provides a verbose description of the features and gaps.

  Example:
  ```plaintext
  Feature1: 10, Feature2: 20, Gap: 34, Feature1: 30, Feature2: 40
  ```



## Biological Context

In the context of genomic research, transforming feature data into formats suitable for training LLMs is crucial for various applications such as predicting gene expression, understanding isoform switches, and identifying regulatory elements. The ability to compare genomic conditions and format the results for machine learning models enables researchers to leverage advanced computational methods for biological discovery.

### Test Split and Multiple Formats

- **Test Split**: Dividing the data into training and test sets ensures that models can be evaluated on unseen data, providing a measure of their generalization performance.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Supporting various output formats allows flexibility in how data is presented and consumed by different machine learning frameworks and models.

This vignette provides an overview of the `GenomicLLM` package, demonstrating its capabilities in reading, processing, and transforming genomic data for machine learning applications. The use of S4 objects ensures robust and scalable data management, making `GenomicLLM` a powerful tool for bioinformatics research.

### Conclusion
GenomicLLM provides a powerful suite of tools for transforming genomic feature data into formats suitable for training language models. Its use of S4 objects ensures robust data handling, and its functions are designed to facilitate genomic data comparisons and machine learning workflows. This package is particularly useful for bioinformaticians and researchers looking to leverage machine learning in genomic studies.

### Future Work
Future enhancements to GenomicLLM may include additional functionalities for more complex genomic data analyses and integration with other bioinformatics tools. Your contributions and feedback are welcome to make this package even more powerful and user-friendly.
